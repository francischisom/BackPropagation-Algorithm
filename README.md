# Backpropagation in CNNs Using Heart/Lung Audio Classification

## Overview
This project shows training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using backpropagation to classify audio. Audio signals are first converted to Mel-spectrograms to be used as input for the model.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the role of backpropagation in deep learning
- Explore how CNNs learn from spectrogram-based audio features
- Implement and train a CNN using TensorFlow
- Interpret training results and model performance

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of three categories of audio signals:
- Heart sounds (HS)
- Lung sounds (LS)
- Mixed sounds (Mix)

Each category is accompanied by a metadata CSV file containing identifiers for the corresponding audio files.

### Data Representation

Rather than feeding raw audio signals directly into the neural network, each audio file is converted into a Mel-spectrogram. This transformation converts time-series audio into a two-dimensional representation of frequency content over time.

This approach enables the use of Convolutional Neural Networks, which are highly effective for extracting spatial features from image-like inputs.

### Dataset Source
The dataset is based on some public biomedical audio datasets that are used for heart and lung sounds classification in many researches and educational works.

## Why the Dataset is Not Included
The dataset is not included in this repository because:
•⁠  ⁠Audio files are large and exceed GitHub size limits
•⁠  ⁠GitHub restricts files larger than 100MB
•⁠  ⁠Including large datasets reduces repository performance and usability

This is a skeleton project. What this means is that this folder structure has been created so that you can copy this project.

## Where is Backpropagation Shown?

Backpropagation is implemented in two key parts of the project:

1. Model Training

   ```python
   model.fit(...)
   ``` 
TensorFlow automatically performs:

•Forward pass
•Loss computation
•Backward pass (backpropagation)
•Weight updates using gradients

2. Explicit Gradient Computation, Using:
 ```python
tf.GradientTape()
 ```
This section computes explicitly the gradients of the loss function w.r.t. to the model parameters. It is a way to illustrate internally the workings of backpropagation.
